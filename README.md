The project focuses on the gesture recognition 

This project is handling by Liu Jinyuan from UESTC, Wang Jiajun from SYSU and Chen Zhengpei from SYSU during our intern time in the Microsoft company.

Hello world !


1. Backgroud Information:  
Attracting new members is the eternal theme of the gym, and the main means of capturing new members in todayâ€™s gyms is still delivering the leaflet, which has certain limitations, one of which is to limit the scope of the promotion. The general mobility of the staffs will not be particularly wide, so only customers in a particular area will know the information about the gyms. The second limitation is that the cost of ordinary leaflets is also quite high, and the gym needs to invest money to attract the employers who will deliever the leaflets. The efficiency of the staff, their three leaflets is also related to the professional conduct of the staff. Some staffs may throw all the leaflets, causing serious losses to the gym. So we proposed to encourage the guests took pictures before our gym glasses and sent friends to attract new customers. The core of the project is that we need to be able to give the user a specific action profile. When the user are satisfied with their photos, they can take this photo and there is a grade which reflects the degree of similarities between the shape of users and the standard shape. 

2. Task Allocation:  
For this project, we think there are three main tasks that we need to complete. The first is to extract the outline of the person, which means we should remove all kinds of complex backgrounds as well as noise, and then extract the shape of the outline. Then based on the need of further processing the contour, we should select the characteristics of the contour to carry out the contour matching, whether to select the similarity degree of the pixel point coordinates or directly detect the users' contour to the size of the specified contour ratio to judge. The third task is to design a matching scoring algorithm to score the user's actions.


3. Extraction of Outline based on the Python
